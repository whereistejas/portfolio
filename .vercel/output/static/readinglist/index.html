Adler suggests various ways to mark a book, such as underlining, circling, or writing in the margins, and emphasizes the benefits of doing so, including better understanding, memory retention, and engagement in a conversation with the author. Finally, he addresses potential objections to marking books, such as lending them to friends, and suggests solutions. </p> </div><div class="flex flex-col gap-0.25 readinglist-item z-1 relative"> <a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/a-chance-to-build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="font-semibold uppercase italic"> <div class="text-pretty">A Chance to Build</div> </a> <span class="text-base text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400"> 13 May 2025 </span> <p class="leading-snug text-base font-normal hyphens-auto text-justify"> Silicon Valley&#39;s success is closely tied to semiconductors, which are made in Asia due to lower labor costs.

Initial efforts often focused on human understanding, but breakthroughs came when researchers embraced computation. The complexity of the mind should not dictate AI design; instead, we should enable AI to discover and learn on its own. </p> </div><div class="flex flex-col gap-0.25 readinglist-item z-1 relative"> <a href="https://www.thepsmiths.com/p/review-reentry-by-eric-berger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="font-semibold uppercase italic"> <div class="text-pretty">REVIEW: Reentry, by Eric Berger</div> </a> <span class="text-base text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400"> 16 Jan 2025 </span> <p class="leading-snug text-base font-normal hyphens-auto text-justify"> Eric Berger&#39;s book &quot;Reentry&quot; explores how SpaceX, under Elon Musk, revolutionized the space industry by taking significant risks and prioritizing speed and innovation.
