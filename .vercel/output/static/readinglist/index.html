Initial efforts often focused on human understanding, but breakthroughs came when researchers embraced computation. The complexity of the mind should not dictate AI design; instead, we should enable AI to discover and learn on its own.</p>  </div> </div><div class="flex flex-col gap-0.5

Researchers are calling for a different approach called degrowth, which focuses on securing human well-being and reducing unnecessary production. Implementing degrowth strategies can lower carbon emissions, stabilize employment, and enable sustainable development.</p>  </div> </div><div class="flex flex-col gap-0.5

Mayr emphasizes that scientific progress often comes from asking the right questions rather than technological advancements. He believes that good questions can lead to significant discoveries, even if the initial answers are incorrect.</p>  </div> </div><div class="flex flex-col gap-0.5
