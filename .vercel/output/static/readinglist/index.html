These novels offer rich simulations of human experiences, enhancing our ability to think across different perspectives. They provide a unique glimpse into the emotional and cognitive aspects of life in earlier times, making them valuable for full-spectrum thinking.</p>  </div> </div><div class="row"> <div class="key"> 2/8/2025 </div> <div class="value">  <p> <a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2025/02/07/thread-safe-memory-copy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Thread-safe memory copy </a> <span class="kind">#rss</span> </p> <p class="summary">Copying memory in multi-threaded environments can lead to unpredictable results if one thread modifies the data while another is copying it. This situation, known as a data race, occurs when multiple threads access the same memory location without proper synchronization. To avoid crashes and undefined behavior, programmers can implement safe memory copy functions using atomic operations, though this may result in slower performance.</p>  </div> </div><div class="row"> <div class="key"> 2/7/2025 </div> <div class="value">  <p> <a href="https://scholars-stage.org/do-not-trust-journalists-a-mormon-example/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Do Not Trust Journalists (A Mormon Example) </a> <span class="kind">#article</span> </p> <p class="summary">The New York Times faced criticism for its obituary of Thomas Monson, the former leader of the Mormon Church, focusing on his rejections of social changes rather than his significant contributions. Critics argue that the Times&#39; framing reflects a narrow perspective on journalism, ignoring the broader impact of Monson&#39;s life and legacy.

American elevators are larger and more expensive than those in other parts of the world due to stringent regulations and union restrictions on preassembly and prefabrication. To make elevators more affordable and abundant, reforms are needed to align with global standards, increase competition, and improve vocational training for native-born workers.</p>  </div> </div><div class="row"> <div class="key"> 1/19/2025 </div> <div class="value">  <p> <a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/07/artificial-wombs-when" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Artificial Wombs When? </a> <span class="kind">#article</span> </p> <p class="summary">Advancements in reproductive technology, like artificial wombs, are focused on helping extremely premature infants rather than replacing natural pregnancy.
