Whenever someone asks me for a book recommendation, I always offer something from this list. I thought it would be really nice to make my first blog post about the books I love.

## Samarkand by Amin Maalouf
[Samarkand](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/142395) tells the story of Omar Khayyam, a Persian polymath. Woven with beautiful prose, scientific curiosity and political upheavals, the story forces to the reader to step out of our current time.

## The Way Things Were by Aatish Taseer
"The way things were" is the literal translation of the Sanskrit word, "_itihaas_" meaning history. The book attempts to juxtapose the political climate of India against the Sanskrit, pulling us into the Sanskrit etymology of modern day concepts. Understanding Indian languages, is a crucial step towards India and Sanskrit albeit a dead language, is probably the most apt choice, because all modern Indian are derived from Sanskrit to some degree.

## Tomb of Sand by Geetanjali Shree
It may seem as if the Partition of India and Pakistan happened a long time ago. However modern-day South Asia, still struggles from the consequences of the Partition. Tomb of Sand is a mind boggling book that begins like a mad man's fever dream, melting reality, history and language into a cauldron of words and imaginations (never will I able to look at an umbrella just as umbrella). Personal struggles, family struggles, the struggle between western and Indian values are all welcomed onto the stage. Geetanjali Shree leaves no emotion unturned.

## A Month in Siena by Hisham Matar
