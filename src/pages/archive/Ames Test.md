title: What is an Ames Test?
---
Ames test is used to detect mutagenic substances. It uses a genetically-engineered strains of Salmonella that are sensitive to mutations caused by a wide range of chemicals. Specifically, it has mutations in its histidine operon, because of which it cannot synthesise histidine, an amino acid that the bacteria needs for growth and replication.

When a population is grown in an agar plate with a trace amount of histidine, most of the bacteria die but some use the trace amount of histidine to reproduce and spontaneously revert to the histidine-independent wild-type, that is able to synthesise histidine on its own. Each generation produced in this way has a natural spontaneous mutant frequency that can be quantified.

The mutations in its histidine operon that make it dependent on an external supply of histidine, act as hot spots for mutagens to act on. By comparing the how many revertant colonies are present in the presence of a mutagen (after 48 hours at 37 C) to the revertant colonies on a control plate, we can determine the mutagenic potential of different substances.

However, bacterias donâ€™t have some of the mammalian metabolic reactions (like oxidation and reduction). For this reason, we may need to add other rat liver products to cover the mutagenic behaviour of a substance from the intermediate products formed during those reactions.
