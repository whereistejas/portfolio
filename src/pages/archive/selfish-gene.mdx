5. **Aggression**: explains ESS with example of aggression and applies it to evolutionary stable set of genes.

## Why is man?

- Individuals are not inherently fighting for the betterment of the species as a whole, because individuals are selfish. Individuals are selfish because, genes are selfish, themselves.
- In special circumstances a gene can achieve its own selfish goals by fostering a limited form of altruism at the level of individual animals.
- The author thinks that universal love and welfare of the species do not make evolutionary sense.
- An entity is said to be _altruistic_ if it behaves so as to increase another entity's welfare at the expense of its own. By welfare, we mean _chances of survival_. The opposite it said to be _selfish_.
- These definitions of altruism and selfishness are _behavioural_ not _subjective_. They completely ignore the motives behind the altruistic or selfish behaviour, and only consider the effect on another entity's chances of survival.
- Group selection assumes that natural selection will favour traits that benefit the species as a whole, even if they are detrimental to the individual; Individual selection makes the opposite claim.
- The author suggests a misconception about altruism, that species evolve to do things for the good of the species. This arises from the Darwinian ideas of natural selection, implying the survival of the fittest, extended to the idea of "group selection", where a group with more self-sacrificing individuals will be less likely to go extinct.
- Dawkins supports "individual selection", preferring "gene selection" in particular because:
  - In a group with at least one selfish individual, the selfish individual will outlive all the other altruistic members, because they’re willing to exploit the altruism of others.
  - Supporters of "group selection", cannot seem to agree on what level of "group" is the most important.
- The author argues as the smallest level of individualism, the genes, is where natural selection (and self-interest) actually happens.

## The replicators

- The author generalises the _survival of the fittest_ as the _survival of the stable_.
- Earth before life came to be, had abundant supply of water, carbon dioxide, methane and ammonia.
- These gave birth to primordial biochemical molecules that could self-replicate.
- However the process of self replication is not perfect. There will be a certain amount of miscopying.
- So whatever the original would have been like, after some time we will end up with groups with slightly different arrangements of molecules.
- The population of each variety depends on their longevity, speed of replication (fecundity) and accuracy of replication (copying fidelity).
- Evolution is the upward trend of the self replicating molecules performed on these 3 metrics.
- Evolution is a natural result of the competition enforced by finite amounts of resources available.

## Immortal coils

- DNA is
  - a replicator molecule.
  - is made of A, T, G and C nucleotides.
  - supervises the manufacturing of proteins.
- Genes control embryonic development because, natural selection prefers genes that build better survival machines.
- Genes are not doing this consciously or purposefully. They still follow automatic selection for optimising longevity, fecundity and copying fidelity.
- The same gene may collaborate with each other genes to perform different functions in different parts of the body.

### Sexual reproduction

- Sexual reproduction has the effective of reshuffling of genes. A combination of genes in any one body is short lived, but the genes themselves have a very long lifespan.
- A human has 46 chromosomes (which are actually 23 pairs), and we receive each chromosome from either our mother or father.
- Each chromosome in a pair, is a direct and complete alternate for its partner.
- During _meiosis_, each pair is reduced to a single chromosome, by randomly mixing genes from the each chromosome in the pair, halving the number of chromosomes to 23.
- This means that each sperm and egg has a unique combination of genes.
- The random selection of genes between chromosomes is called _crossing over_.
- A DNA chain has special markers for START OF PROTEIN and END OF PROTEIN. We can call the sequence between these markers, a gene. It is also referred to as _cistron_. Many geneticists use the two words interchangeably.
- _Crossing over_ does not respect cistron boundaries.
- The author borrows the definition of _gene_ as a portion of chromosomal material that potentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit for natural selection, from G. C. Williams.
- The shorter a gene is (in length), the longer it is likely to live, because it is less prone to changes by _crossing over_.
- Most of the time _crossing over_ is responsible for creating new genetic units, by rearranging pre-existing sub-units in a new sequence.
- Another way in which a new genetic unit is through _point mutation_, which is the incorrect copying of a single nucleotide. The longer a genetic unit, the more likely this is to occur.
- Another kind of mutation is _inversion_. A chromosome detaches itself, flips itself and rejoins. Sometimes, parts of a chromosome do this, or even get attached to a different location or a different chromosome.
- This kind of inversion, often brings together genes that complement each other, creating a collection of genes with a tight _linkage_.

### missing title

- Species, individuals, chromosomes, cistrons are all too large to survive unchanged for more than one generation.
- Whatever the fundamental unit of natural selection is, it must survive unchanged for a very long period of time.
- The fundamental unit of natural selection should have three properties: longevity, fecundity and copying-fidelity.
- A gene is _potentially near-immortal_, by surviving in the form of its copies.
- Natural selection pressure, decides how long a gene will live (through its copies):
  > Exactly how long is 'long enough'? There is no hard and fast answer. It will depend on how severe the natural selection 'pressure' is. That is, on how much more likely a 'bad' genetic unit is to die than its 'good' allele.
- A long-lived/good gene is good at making _better_ survival machines than the other short-lived/bad genes.
- Are there any universal properties that can instantly mark a gene as _good_ or _bad_? Yes, _selfishness_ is one such universal property.
- A long-lived gene cannot be altruistic and always be selfish, because it is competing with its alleles for the same spot on the chromosome.
  > The gene is the basic unit of selfishness.
- Even though a gene is selfish, it must cooperate with other genes (not its own alleles) to form survival machines. Genes interact with each other in intricate ways to provide their survival mechanisms higher chances of survival, no single gene does all the work, but one gene’s presence may make more than enough of a difference compared its alleles. (Rewrite this sentence).
- Good and bad genes are not weeded out in single generations, but rather through a process of iteration over multiple generations.
  > Luck by definition, good or bad, is random. A gene which is consistently on the losing side is not unlucky; it is a bad gene.
- Genes are the unit of natural selection because of two facts: sexual reproduction and individual mortality. They need sexual reproduction because crossing over is essential for genes to copy themselves and go on living in another body. Genes keep living on forever in newer and newer, because individuals keep dying after specific lifespans. So why do we have sex and why are we mortal?
- Sir Peter Medawar has a theory which uses evolutionary thinking to explain old age. His theory suggests that different genes are activated at different points in the lifecycle of an organism. _Good_ genes tend to postpone the death of their survival machines at least until after reproduction. Which means that semi-lethal and senility causing genes can stay in the gene pool and reproduce as long as they do so after reproduction.
  > Medawar also pointed out that alleles with positive effects on performance early in life, but with negative effects because of physiological trade-offs later on, are more likely to be established by selection than alleles with the opposite pattern. This idea was more fully developed by WillIams (1957) and is now known as the "antagonistic pleiotropy" theory of aging (RosE 1991, Chap. 4). <MarginNote text="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1461325/"/ >

  > The long-term consequences of non-random individual death and reproductive success are manifested in the form of changing gene frequencies in the gene pool. With reservations, the gene pool plays the same role for the modern replicators as the primeval soup did for the original ones. Sex and chromosomal crossing-over have the effect of preserving the liquidity of the modern equivalent of the soup. Because of sex and crossing-over the gene pool is kept well stirred, and the genes partially shuffled. Evolution is the process by which some genes become more numerous and others less numerous in the gene pool… whenever we are trying to explain the evolution of some characteristic, such as altruistic behaviour, of asking ourselves simply: 'what effect will this characteristic have on frequencies of genes in the gene pool?'

## Gene Machine

This chapter is mostly about the different behavioural techniques have developed in “survival machines” through natural selection.

- Locomotion
- Sensation
- Thinking & consciousness
- Communication

We are introduced to the notion that a survival machine is run by a brain, the brain is a computer that controls the behaviour of the machine based on a program, that consists of pre-defined instructions and objectives. This program is written by genes. The most primary objective can be ensuring the survival of the genes inside the survival machine.

A body is made of individual genes, each with their selfish motives. Even though the body is a collective, it operates as a unit because natural selection favours genes that cooperate with each other. This cooperative behaviour of genes means that a survival machine tries to maximise the survival chances of all the genes inside it.

#### Behaviour and it’s evolution

Behaviour is defined as movement that is fast, reversible and repeatable an indefinite number of times. This kind of behaviour is displayed by animals. Plant movement (if it can be called that) is actually growth and irreversible.

Animals developed muscles for rapid movement. Muscles are special because they enable timed movement. The movement of muscles is controlled by neurones, collections of neurones are called _ganglia_ or brains when they get big enough. For the brain to coordinate muscle movements, it needs information about events in reality, which is why sensory organs were developed. In order to enrich the way a brain reacts to external events, _memory_ was invented. This allowed events from the past to influence the reaction to events in the present.

Memory and sensory events allow the brain to show _purposiveness_. This means that the brain is trying to maintain a desired state. The optimisation happens through negative feedback.

#### Programming by genes.

The reason genes program us the way we program computers is because the genes cannot always be present to react to new environmental conditions. The survival machine needs to be autonomous because the “feedback” cycle of genes is in the scale of lifetimes. This is the time-lag problem.

> Genes work by controlling protein synthesis.

This means that their reaction times are too slow, which is the opposite of behaviour. The genes must program their survival machines in advance to cope with as many eventualities as they can anticipate. The program cannot be specific instructions but rather has to be general strategies.

> Genes have to perform a task analogous to prediction.

## Aggression

For each survival machine, everything (living or dead) other than members of its species and close relatives can be considered as part of the environment. Since each individual machine is selfish, it will exploit everything in its environment to ensure its own survival.

Selfishness doesn't imply that individuals<MarginNote text="Help help"/> start killing rivals of the same species.

Individuals compete with other individuals in order to exploit the environment for their own survival. The competition is stronger between individuals of the same species compared to other species.

Since they compete much more fiercely with members of their own species, it makes sense for them to start eliminating their brethren. However, most species do practice wantonly killing of their own or cannibalism.

- Individuals must justify wanton violence by some overwhelming advantage that the violence will get them. However, most individuals in most situations, cannot make that justification.
- Killing competitors from their own species involves a great risk to themselves and even their success might end up benefiting others more than themselves.

The cost-benefit analysis that individuals need to instigate a violent attack against another, and at each tactical point in that incident to decide if they should escalate the fight or cool it off, can be seen through the eyes of _Game Theory_.
This idea has been pushed by J. Maynard Smith in collaboration with G. R. Price and G. A. Parker. The concept introduced by them is called _Evolutionary Stable Strategy_.

In this context, a strategy is a preprogrammed behavioural policy. An ESS is defined as a strategy which, if most in a population decide to opt into, cannot be bettered by an alternative strategy. This means that a group can impact what is the best strategy for an individual. It is not the same as an optimum that can be achieved through conspiracy.

An ESS is a strategy which maximises the payoff for all the different individuals involved. Different individuals can employ different strategies to maximise their payoff, such as the retaliator, the bully, the prober-retaliator. Not all of these strategies are stable. Only the retaliator is. These strategies are about aggression.

But not all species participate in aggression, some only posture in a war of attrition.

Different organisms employ different strategies when competing for resources, however they all do the same cost-benefit analysis. This means, that depending on how strong each individual is and how much they need a particular resource, we can determine which strategies have the highest payoffs and which strategies are stable. Different kinds of asymmetries can arise during competitions between individuals for resources, such as fighting ability or size.

> Whenever there is a strong asymmetry in a contest, ESSs are likely to be conditional strategies dependent on the asymmetry. */}
