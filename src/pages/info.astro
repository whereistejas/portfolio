            My name is Tejas Sanap. I live in London (arguably, one of the best
            cities in the world). I work as a Rust engineer at a startup. Apart
            from software and functional programming, I'm also an amateur street
            photographer. I am an avid reader and am currently reading

          <p>We are here to make the world a better place either by: solving new problems or improving existing solutions.</p>
          <p><br></p>
          <p>Most problems can only be solved if there is enough justification for someone to invest in them. The likelihood of investment can be understood in terms of “difficulty of solving” and “benefits from solving”.</p>
          <p><br></p>
          <p>We can justify solving problems with no clear solutions if there are enough benefits. We can also justify solving problems with little benefits because of how easy they are to solve. We can describe these two categories as the investor’s comfort zone. However, our society has evolved to disincentivize investment in problems outside this comfort zone.</p>
          <p><br></p>
          <p>Somewhere in our single-minded pursuit of "sexy" problems to create infinite <a class="underline" href="https://openai.com/index/planning-for-agi-and-beyond/">abundance</a> or move back to being <a class="underline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrowth">hunter-gatherer tribes</a>, we have forgotten that for most people the experience of living through their routine lives is far from optimal and must be improved.</p>
          <p><br></p>
          <p>The problems outside the comfort zone are often “not sexy”, they won’t 10x the GDP nor will they create a future so abundant that none of us will have to work or worry again. We need to start thinking about these problems in terms of improving the human experience (HX). We can <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/what-is-user-experience/">define</a> HX as the holistic relationship — encompassing aspirations, struggles and successes — between a person and their lived life.</p>
          <p><br></p>
          <p>Some examples of good HX would be accessible healthcare, cheap credit, reliable public transport, shorter commute times, simplified governmental services, clean air and water, access to green spaces.</p>
          <p><br></p>
          <p>The world doesn’t need another CRM, sales/marketing, accounting tool. But we do need all of the things I mentioned above.</p>
