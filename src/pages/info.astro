							We are here to make the world a better place either by: solving
							new problems or improving existing solutions.
						</p>
						<p>
							Most problems can only be solved if there is enough justification
							for someone to invest in them. The likelihood of investment can be
							understood in terms of “difficulty of solving” and “benefits from
							solving”.
						</p>
						<p>
							We can justify solving problems with no clear solutions if there
							are enough benefits. We can also justify solving problems with
							little benefits because of how easy they are to solve. We can
							describe these two categories as the investor’s comfort zone.
							However, our society has evolved to disincentivize investment in
							problems outside this comfort zone.
						</p>
						<p>
							Somewhere in our single-minded pursuit of "sexy" problems to
							create infinite <a

								>abundance</a
							> or move back to being <a
								class="underline"
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrowth"
								>hunter-gatherer tribes</a
							>, we have forgotten that for most people the experience of living
							through their routine lives is far from optimal and must be
							improved.
						</p>
						<p>
							The problems outside the comfort zone are often “not sexy”, they
							won’t 10x the GDP nor will they create a future so abundant that
							none of us will have to work or worry again. We need to start
							thinking about these problems in terms of improving the human
							experience (HX). We can <a
								href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/what-is-user-experience/"
								>define</a
							> HX as the holistic relationship — encompassing aspirations, struggles
							and successes — between a person and their lived life.
						</p>
						<p>
							Some examples of good HX would be accessible healthcare, cheap
							credit, reliable public transport, shorter commute times,
							simplified governmental services, clean air and water, access to
							green spaces.
